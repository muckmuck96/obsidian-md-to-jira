  Convert your note/selection into jira markup and vice versa!
</div>


---

## Install
You can find Markdown to Jira in the list of community plugins!

If the plugin is not yet on the community list:
- download the latest release files **main.js** & **manifest.json** [here](https://github.com/muckmuck96/obsidian-md-to-jira/releases/latest)
- create a folder called `obsidian-md-to-jira` in the `.obsidian/plugins` folder of the vault to be installed
- place the **main.js** & **manifest.json** from the release there
- now you should be able to enable the plugin in the plugins tab of obsidian

## Usage
There are two ways to convert your markdown into jira markup. In both ways, the note has to be in **editor view**.

1. Focus the note you want to convert and use the command: `Note to Jira markup (clipboard) command`
2. Select some markdown you want to convert and use the command: `Selection to Jira markup (clipboard)`

Vice versa, you can convert jira markup into markdown using the command: `Jira markup (clipboard) to markdown note`

## Credits
The converter is based on [this project](https://github.com/FokkeZB/J2M)
